## About Me

Leveraging my previous 2 years experience as a Unidata software engineer I have transitioned into the world of web development.

I have rediscovered the satisfaction of problem solving and embraced a new challenge in creating good UI/UX.

This repo is a showcase of what I have been able to create as a full-stack devleloper.

## NC News Back-End

[link](https://github.com/josh-raftery/be-nc-news)

This is an API created for the purpose of building a news site application such as Reddit. I coded endpoints for articles, comments, users etc. which access a postgreSQL database containing sample data.

This application was created with a stack of node.js, express.js, jest and postgreSQL. It has a full-testing suite with over 100 tests and meticulous error handling.

## NC News Front-End

This is a for website displaying, reading and commenting on articles.


**The application is feature-rich and has functionality for the following:**


**Topics Page** - listing all available topics on cards which will link you to articles for the specified topic.

**Post Article Page** - allowing you to create an article of your own.

**Article Filters** - you can sort by date, votes (likes), most comments and order by filters of top and bottom (asc, desc).

**Day/Night mode** - adjusting the CSS from a lighter scheme to a dark one and vise versa - adjusting icons to remain a strong contrast.

**Suggested Articles** - If you are using a wide display such as a laptop - suggested articles will fill the otherwise dead space to the side(s) of an article card.

**Pagination** - Articles are displayed 10 at a time and on a button press are added to the page.

**Styling, Design and Accessability choices:**

**Responsive** - Loading component displayed in between API request and response, Input fields turn red and display error message upon invalid input or bad connection.

**Opimistic Rendering** - Where possible I used optimistic rendering for a more pleasant user experience.

**Mobile First** - The application works well with any screen size utilising flex styling.

This is very much a work in progress - more to come!

## NC Marketplace

**Features:**

**View All Items/Home Page -** calls API and displays all active listings.

**View Item -** View individual Item with ability to add item to basket.

**Profile -** View profile information - active listings, basket.

**List item -** Form with validation, designed to procure a POST request to the API.

**Nav -** Basket, Home, List Item links.  

## Gify API Gif Search

This was my first go at making a react app and you can see the progression compared to nc-news!

Functionality to search for a GIF and the app accesses the gify API and displays the content - additional feature to upload a GIF and the app fashions a POST request.
